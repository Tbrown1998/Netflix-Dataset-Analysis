![](https://github.com/najirh/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores Netflix‚Äôs vast library of movies and TV shows using SQL, aiming to uncover **content trends, distribution patterns, and audience preferences.** By analyzing the dataset, we derive key insights into content types, ratings, release trends, country-wise distribution, and genre classifications.  

### **Key Objectives**  
- Understand the **distribution** of content (Movies vs. TV Shows).  
- Identify the **most common ratings** and their target audiences.  
- Analyze **content trends by release year and country** to uncover regional preferences.  
- Investigate **popular genres and their frequency**.  
- Examine **actors, directors, and movie durations** for deeper content insights.  

### **Technology Stack**  
- **Database Management:** PostgreSQL  
- **Query Language:** SQL (DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Window Functions)  
- **Data Preparation:** Microsoft Excel

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Link:** [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

### 2. Schemas Setup
- **Database Creation:** The project begins with setting up a database named `netflix_db`.  
- **Table Creation:** Create all neccesary table to store required data.
  
```sql
-- CREATING TABLE 

CREATE TABLE Netflix 
	(
	show_id	VARCHAR (10),
	type VARCHAR (15),
	title VARCHAR (500),
	director VARCHAR (500),
	casts VARCHAR (1000),
	country	VARCHAR (1000),
	date_added DATE,
	release_year INT,
	rating VARCHAR (10),
	duration VARCHAR (30),
	listed_in VARCHAR (500),
	description VARCHAR (1000)
	);

SELECT * FROM netflix

-- Changing Column "date_added" to VARCHAR from data_type DATE
	
ALTER TABLE netflix
ALTER COLUMN date_added TYPE VARCHAR(20)
USING date_added::VARCHAR;

-- Updating Character Length in table

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Netflix;
CREATE TABLE Netflix 
	(
	show_id	VARCHAR (10),
	type VARCHAR (15),
	title VARCHAR (500),
	director VARCHAR (500),
	casts VARCHAR (1000),
	country	VARCHAR (1000),
	date_added DATE,
	release_year INT,
	rating VARCHAR (10),
	duration VARCHAR (30),
	listed_in VARCHAR (500),
	description VARCHAR (1000)
	);

SELECT * FROM netflix

-- Verifying Data

SELECT COUNT (*) total_count 
	FROM netflix;

SELECT DISTINCT type 
FROM Netflix;
```
## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```
### 3. List All Movies Released in 2020

WHERE release_year = '2020'
```
### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

FROM(
	SELECT 
        TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content,
		RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) country_rank
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY 1) sub
WHERE country_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 5
```
### 5. Identify the Longest Movie
```sql
SELECT title,
	duration
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```
### 6. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE date_added >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 year';
```
### 7. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

		SELECT
			EXTRACT (Year FROM date_added) release_date,
			COUNT (*) movie_count,
			ROUND(COUNT (*)::numeric/(SELECT COUNT (*)
								FROM netflix 
								WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 0) average
		FROM netflix
		WHERE country = 'India'
		GROUP BY 1
		)sub
	)sub2
WHERE year_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY average DESC
```
### 11. List All Movies that are Documentaries
